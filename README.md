# 100 Days of Python
I created this repo to showcase my progress in the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course by Angela Yu.

My main objective is to upload my solutions to the projects assigned in each section (or day) of the course as a way to stay commited and be consistent in my learning path.
